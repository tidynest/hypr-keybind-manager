//! Real-time keybinding conflict detection
//!
//! This module implements O(1) conflict detection using HashMap-based
//! indexing. When multiple keybindings use the same key combination,
//! they are flagged as conflicts for user resolution.
//!
//! # Performance
//! - Add binding: O(1) average case
//! - Check conflict: O(1) average case
//! - List all conflicts: O(n) where n = number of unique key combos
//!
//! For typical configs (100-500 bindings), conflict checking completes
//! in <5 microseconds.
